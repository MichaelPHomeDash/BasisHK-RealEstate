### Master Prompt

**A hyper-realistic, cinematic 4K timelapse video. The camera is completely static, positioned at eye-level in a hallway, looking into a living and dining area. The shot is wide and captures the entire transformation from a single, fixed perspective. No camera movement, zooms, or angle changes.**

**The sequence begins with the space being bright, clean, and completely empty, featuring fresh white walls and new light-colored wood flooring. Sunlight streams in, creating a bright and airy feel.**

**Over the course of the timelapse, a team of 2-3 Asian movers, shown with natural motion blur, efficiently bring in furniture. They place a natural wood console table against the right wall, set up a round wooden dining table with matching chairs in the center, and position several large potted plants, including a Monstera and a palm tree, to add life to the space.**

**As the furnishing completes, they hang framed botanical art on the walls. The scene transitions to the final state: a beautifully decorated, cozy, and serene home with a warm, inviting atmosphere. A stylish pendant light above the dining table is now switched on, casting a soft, warm glow. The final shot lingers, showcasing the perfect Scandinavian-Japandi interior design.**
